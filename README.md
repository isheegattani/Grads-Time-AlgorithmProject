Description on how to run the code:
*.py files (biggraph.py;graph01.py;graph02.py)are the input files that contain the appropriate code for
the topological sorting followed by computing the longest path of DAG along with the length of the path
which can be executed as python filename.py into the command line then hit enter. Else, we can also use
the IDEs like Jupyter, Pycharm, Spyder, Atom to execute the code by hitting the run command.
Steps:
1.User have to provide the graph detailed inputs for each of the above-mentioned python files.
2.Code would be then processed for topological sorting first followed by computing the longest path.
3. And the output would be printed showing the longest path along with the length of the path.
